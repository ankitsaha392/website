         As part of the project, I also developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, adding a fun and interactive element to the platform. 
         Players can choose between 'X' and 'O' and enjoy the game against a friends. 
         The game features a user-friendly interface and intuitive gameplay, providing a delightful experience for users. <br><br>

        In this project, I developed a Spotify clone that allows users to listen to music from their device in offline mode,
         providing them with the flexibility to enjoy their favorite tracks at any time, anywhere.

        I designed and developed a responsive portfolio website to showcase my profile, projects, and skills. 
        The website allows viewers to easily navigate through my work, learn about my background, and get in touch with me.
         It is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless viewing experience for all users.<br><br>

        As part of this project, I developed a basic Notepad application with a range of features to enhance the user experience.
         Users can write their thoughts and utilize standard text editing functionalities such as copy, paste, and cut. Additionally, the application offers options to save, saveAs, print, and exit, providing users with full control over their text.
         The application is designed to be user-friendly and allows for customization of text according to the user's preferences.<br><br>

        <br><br>
        In this project, I created a Journal Management System that facilitates the submission, review, and editing of manuscripts for academic journals. 
        Authors can submit their manuscripts through the system, which are then accessible to editors. Editors can view the submitted manuscripts, assign reviewers based on expertise, and manage the review process.
         Reviewers can access assigned manuscripts, provide comments and feedback, and contribute to the decision-making process.
         This system streamlines the journal management process, making it more efficient and collaborative for all parties involved.<br><br>

        In this project, we developed a Garbage Collector application that allows users to schedule garbage collection based on their preferences. Users can select the type of garbage they want to dispose of and provide their location.
         Our partners then visit the specified location within 24 hours to collect the garbage. As a reward for using our service, customers receive some rewards, incentivizing them to participate in keeping their surroundings clean.<br><br>
